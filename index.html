          <p>You don't need to enter most of your media manually. Discogs.com has an extensive collection of barcodes.</p>
          <p>And if the barcode is missing, you can quickly search for the missing information. No need to enter all data.</p>

          <h2>Quick</h2>
          <p>When "endless scanning mode" is turned, you can scan about 10 to 15 items per minute. You have to be a great
          typist to beat that.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <p>Barcodes are much quicker to scan when well lit. So if you're having troubles, go sit by the window or 
          put a desk light above your stack.</p>
